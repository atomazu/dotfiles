# atomazu's dotfiles
## Hey there!
These are my dotfiles, I'm using Archlinux (rolling release) with Hyprland.
Looking into the `.config` folder should give you a good look at what software I use, here is also a screenshot for your viewing pleasure:

## Important note
These files are not prepared to be used by any other people - that's why there is no install script or guide for using these resources. If you are interested I can sort some things out and make it a bit more usable.
